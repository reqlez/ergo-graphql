 * A **variable-length quantity (VLQ)** is a universal code that uses an arbitrary number
 * of binary octets (eight-bit bytes) to represent an arbitrarily large integer. A VLQ
 * is essentially a base-128 representation of an unsigned integer with the addition of
 * the eighth bit to mark continuation of bytes. VLQ is identical to LEB128 except in
 * endianness. See the example below.
